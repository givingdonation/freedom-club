\section*{Introduction}
Even if I don't change this version of the anticode, you can consider it a work in progress, because I do not claim to be finished with it.\\This anticode is an anti-code — it aims to decodify strictly arranged ideas rather than codify them.
\subsection{}
Do whatever you want with this anticode — modify it, distribute it, show it to your neighbor — but be aware of cause and effect.
\subsection{}
This anticode is not a moral obligation — in contrary to your typical ethical code. You can still consider yourself or be considered a Freedom Club member if you somehow deviate from it. It's neither prescriptive nor descriptive. It is propositionary.
\subsection{}
You are encouraged to publish your own renditions, editions and iterations if this anticode.
\subsection{}
Feel free to agree with some points and disagree with others. Actually, it'd be very admirable if you also discuss it anywhere.
\subsection{}
This introduction is an adapted form of the first section of the \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/metaanarchy/comments/iwlqz8/the_metaanarchist_ethical_anticode/}{Meta-Anarchist Ethical Anticode}.

There is no one form of, and likely no set of related forms of politics that are best for the world. all forms need some assumptions because there is no one sole absolute truth. to be free, we need to expand the amount of forms of politics that are up for consideration fast enough that there is a good chance a suitable one for your situation will be considered. In this sense even a politics that involves imposing over others may be good to study, as long as it won't involve shutting ourselves from other politics, as long as we know to stop it from imposing. Recognizing imposition is important, however since dividing things into strict camps of impositionary and non-impositionary is itself impositionary, recognizing imposition isn't about telling others what is and isn't impositionary, but rather sharing as many details as propositionarily possible about what could make something impositionary and what could make it propositionary. Thats why we can openly discuss freedom club having freedom oppression and so on. We are signifying the possibility of imposition but not shutting down a concept. Thats one reason why this club itself can be more of a story than a group, because that likely enables even less restriction in many aspects including this.

%This structure is poop, delete it and move it else where, better try again, make an anticode that is more simple, based on ethical considerations, similar to the other anticode, and takes suggestions from others
By being a story of freedom we can explore all kinds of ideology and there effects live, it is the live action roleplay for all politics, so true freedom lies within it because it can be anything itself, and allow anyone to be anything. We cant force people to participate, only encourage them, with consent and without coersion, if we hope not to force anything on anyone, to let everyone be free, then things strictly outside whats considered necessity should be favored. however it is subjective what counts, we better lean towards no doing harm, people can decide for themselves, and we trust that because thats what makes up the tenet for freedom, if everyone affected can agree however, and consideration is made for those that cant voice ther concern then we can go through with experiments that may be questionable, and be sure to be dynamic, stop your participation if it becomes problematic. There is a certain balence between not doing harm and finding good results, the proposal of the club is that because it is not defined in organization, it cannot harm without some level of participation, some ability to be changed, and there for the hierarchies it imposes can be challenged meaningfully by those effected. This assumption may not be right, but the idea being malluable allows the tenets to be changed.

being free can extend to ethics itself. By the fact that the club is about freedom, it is meant to also free ethics. Freedom club being freedom could represent that there is no imposition of ethics over others or its members. Whatever ethical considerations on member has are as valid to be used as any other member or entity outside of freedom club. And what counts as freedom clubs ethics is not defined, since it can include all ethical beliefs of its members or its sub-entities, or those that may be adjacent. Whats considered right is not imposing over those ethical considerations or those outside the group, however the avocation of ethics by any members is not counted as imposing, but rather can count as proposing and the judgement of that proposition is free to be thought of by others as however they consider, and make whatever groups about it, however they should also not be impositional, propositionality should be seeked in all aspects even to itself, all things are propositional in a system like this, when nothing is solid, everything will be swimming.
To make freedom club an idea rather than a defined group with a goal helps in this respect. Some organization may be needed, in fact it may even be seeked to prove points of the members that agree, and as long as they dont become overly propositional, as the members and themselves decide, they can be okay. In fact the greatest problem is those that are affected, but cant voice there opinions, those with a voice can make the over-impositionality clear if it exists, and those that are not affected at all ideally should add on in case they are themselves being impositional, however since there are voiceless people in the world, there needs to be careful consideration of them, and there fore the voices of the non-affected do need to be considered when it concerns making sure the silent can be heard. Essentially, the consideration of those that cant stop a potential imposition or explicit but purposeful imposition, needs to be cared for extremely, non-affected can be unbiased sources, and all opinions need to be heard, within and outside to make sure the silent are heard. as long as these considerations are made the group can continue, though it should head for the goal of propositionality, however at times to achieve true propositionality, some impositionality needs to be done, because propositionality is just broken down impositionality, perhaps by making an imposition you can make it break down larger ones, however that imposition needs to have A. consideration for the voiceless, which are those that matter to impositonality, without there existence there wouldnt be an impositionality just an advocation and consensus decition, a proposition that is successful, B. not be larger/more impositional that what it aims to break down. voicelessness also includes disability, it is broad to all types, and should be considered broadly.

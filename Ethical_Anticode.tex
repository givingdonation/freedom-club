\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
Even if I don't change this version of the anticode, you can consider it a work in progress, because I do not claim to be finished with it.\\This anticode is an anti-code — it aims to decodify strictly arranged ideas rather than codify them.
\subsection{}
Do whatever you want with this anticode — modify it, distribute it, show it to your neighbor — but be aware of cause and effect.
\subsection{}
This anticode is not a moral obligation — in contrary to your typical ethical code. You can still consider yourself or be considered a Freedom Club member if you somehow deviate from it. It's neither prescriptive nor descriptive. It is propositionary.
\subsection{}
You are encouraged to publish your own renditions, editions and iterations if this anticode.
\subsection{}
Feel free to agree with some points and disagree with others. Actually, it'd be very admirable if you also discuss it anywhere.
\subsection{}
This introduction is an adapted form of the first section of the \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/metaanarchy/comments/iwlqz8/the_metaanarchist_ethical_anticode/}{Meta-Anarchist Ethical Anticode}.
%This structure is poop, delete it and move it else where, better try again, make an anticode that is more simple, based on ethical considerations, similar to the other anticode, and takes suggestions from others
\section{The word freedom is free from meaning}
\subsection{}
Freedom is clearly not a word we would strictly define, it might be ironic if we did. Freedom is in general
\section{Freedom club is free from existing, from purpose}
\section{Freedom club is free from boredom, from definition}
\section{Freedom club is free from philosophy, from ethics}
\section{Freedom club is free from club, from structure}
\section{Freedom club is free from intolerance, from tolerance}
\section{Freedom club is free from morals, from religion}
